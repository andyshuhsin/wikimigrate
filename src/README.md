This folder is the "source" files of the tool.

`data` directory contains records about the countries and their visa policies,
with meta information about things like TOEFL and IELTS

`definitions` includes definitions of the shapes of data.
The definitions are not functional themselves, but they help future developers
to understand and maintain the codebase.

`fe` is for **f**ront-**e**nd code, i.e. things the user actually see in a browser.
